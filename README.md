# SkypeMsgs
This is a simplistic message search utility for exported Skype messages. You go here https://secure.skype.com/en/data-export to request them.
Once you download the export (it may take the system a couple days to make the archive file available) use an archive utility (such as 7-Zip) to open the .tar file,
it will be named skype_convos_[your shype id]_export.tar. Put the messages.json file in the same folder as the SkypeMsgs.exe.

On launch you'll have a search textbox

Enter your search term and press enter or click the search button, this will search the json file and fill the grid with matching messages and their date received.
